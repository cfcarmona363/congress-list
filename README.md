congress-list is an application that connects to https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/members/#lists-of-members and gets a list of congress people.

It uses my own boiler-plate app https://github.com/cfcarmona363/webpack-react-boilerplate wich has a complete react, redux and webpack configuration.
